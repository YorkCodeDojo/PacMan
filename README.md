# NPacMan

PacMan game in C# using .NET Core 3.1

👉 Background
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in April within the UK all York tech events were canceled or moved online. This made Kevin Smith (organizer of dotnet York) and David Betteridge (organiser of York Code Dojo) join together to try an experiment of hosting an online collaborative coding exercise to build PacMan in C#. The First Episode was a success so we decided to continue building out the game as long as possible.

📼 The Episodes are uploaded to YorkDevelopers YouTube Channel
