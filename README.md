## 👉 Background
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in April within the UK all York tech events were canceled or moved online. This made [Kevin Smith](https://github.com/kevbite) (organizer of dotnet York) and [David Betteridge](https://github.com/DavidBetteridge) (organiser of York Code Dojo) join together to try an experiment of hosting an online collaborative coding exercise to build PacMan in C#. The First Episode was a success so we decided to continue building out the game as long as possible.

## 📼 The Episodes are uploaded to YorkDevelopers YouTube Channel
